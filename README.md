# BMI-Calculator
BMI is a measure of relative weight based on an individual’s mass and height.
Body Mass Index is commonly used to classify people as underweight, overweight, and even with obesity.
The body mass index is calculated by dividing an individual’s weight in kilograms by their height in meters, then dividing the answer again by their height.
